<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋. Nice to see You!</h1>

Welcome to my page!

A passionate Full-Stack Developer originally from 🇨🇳 Beijing, China.

I founded NULLSET TECH LLC on March 19, 2025, and have been operating the company since then.

In mid-September 2025, I relocated from 🇺🇸 New Jersey, USA back to 🇨🇳 Beijing, where I am currently based. My current work focuses on AIGC research, with strong interests in robotics and embodied intelligence.

My academic background bridges both hardware and software:
- Bachelor’s degree with a focus on hardware and embedded systems
- Master’s degree with a focus on software and system development

I graduated with a **Master's degree** in **Computer Science** from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) in December 2024.
